title: 'Creating a Flower Shop Through NFTs'

Over the past year I have been learning about the Ethereum blockchain and what it can provide. A utility most have heard of are [non-fungible tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) (NFTs). Some people seem skeptical of them, but I believe their utilizations are being discovered.

## Why NFTs?

The blockchain is a great tool that verifies ownership of digital assets. I want to use this to bridge the gap between online and real life by creating flower NFTs. Online the flowers will provide beauty and fun to people's wallets. I also would like to put them in a game or create a game with them. To bridge the gap, I will invest all the funds raised from the flower NFTs to start an IRL flower shop. I chose a flower shop because I enjoy flowers, but more importantly my fianc√© loves them. It is her dream to start a flower shop, and I would like to help her with that using NFTs.

## The Flower NFTs

*Bearded Iris*

I created the Bearded Iris from a photo that I took at the Missouri Botanical Gardens. The lady and I try to make it to the gardens at least once a month. It is a relaxing place to go and for those that have never been to a botanical garden, I would recommend doing so. The above image is available for purchase [here](https://forms.office.com/r/U7H2tZRrtk) for 2 LRC each.

*Zinnia Elegans*

The Zinna Elegans was taken by my fiance at the Missouri Botanical Gardens. I added a chill track to it that you can listen to [here](https://lexplorer.io/nfts/0x37ea02537f3a7a7ffc221125245905be3d5423e6-0-0xefc18050b98c820ac06a27c929cab3b356d7766b-0x7976e1cd6f68c00c8d404f595c8683cc2a113185525afafae20e5f21fcabda03-5) or in your GameStop wallet after receiving. This flower is also 2 LRC each and you can purchase it by filling out the form [here](https://forms.office.com/r/LJWWjtizqH).

## Crypto Wallet

With the blockchain you can view all transactions of any wallet. You can view my NFTs and the current savings in my [wallet](https://lexplorer.io/account/155667). The long wallet address is 0xc528acbc94e79aa04c08d108b11af52f21167294 and the ENS is flowers.jacobhuber.eth.

So far I have added $200 in 2 LPs. $100 in USDC/LRC and $100 ETH/LRC.

## Thank you

I appreciate all the support that I have been given so far. Around $100 usd has been raised so far. That might not seem like much but it is a great start. Creating art to fund an IRL business is new territory for me but I believe that it can be done. I will be adding content to this article as I release new NFTs and have further updates.

*Note that you will need an L2 wallet on the [Loopring protocol](https://loopring.io/#/) to receive this NFT.
