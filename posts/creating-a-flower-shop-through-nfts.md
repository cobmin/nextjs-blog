title: 'Creating a Flower Shop Through NFTs'

Over the past year I have been learning about the Ethereum blockchain and what it can provide. A utility most have heard of are [non-fungible tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) (NFTs). Some people seem skeptical of them, but I believe their utilizations are being discovered.

## Why NFTs?

The blockchain is a great tool that verifys ownership of digital assets. I want to use this to bridge the gap between online and real life by creating flower NFTs. Online the flowers will provide beauty and fun to peoples wallets. I also would like to put them in a game or create a game with them. To bridge the gap, I will invest all the funds raised from the flower NFTs to start an IRL flower shop. I chose a flower shop because I enjoy flowers, but more importantly my fianc√© loves them. It is her dream to start a flower shop, and I would like to help her with that through the use of NFTs.

## The Flower NFTs

*Beared Iris*

I created the Bearded Iris from a photo that I took at the Missouri Botanical Gardens. The lady and I try to make it to the gardens at least once a month. It is a relaxing place to go and for those that have never been to a botanical garden, I would recommend doing so. The above image is available for purchase [here](https://forms.office.com/r/U7H2tZRrtk) for 2 LRC each.

## Crypto Wallet

With the blockchain you are able to view all transactions of any wallet. You can view my NFTs and the current savings in my [wallet](https://lexplorer.io/account/155667). The long wallet address is 0xc528acbc94e79aa04c08d108b11af52f21167294 and the ENS is flowers.jacobhuber.eth. 

## Thank you

I appreciate all the support that I have been given so far. Creating art to fund an IRL business is new territory for me but I believe that it can be done. I will be adding content to this article as I release new NFTs and have further updates.

*Note that you will need an L2 wallet on the [Loopring protocol](https://loopring.io/#/) to receive this NFT.
