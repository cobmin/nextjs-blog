If you need to monitor an nft collection or perform an airdrop then look no further. Maize is your one stop shop to providing analytics and mass transferring Nfts and crypto on Loopring and Imx.

## Download

The best place to start [is here](https://github.com/cobmin/Maize/blob/main/README.md). Download the package and watch the video to get started.

## How to and Tips

The video gives a good overview and the readme a bit more detail but here are some more tips:

For the API keys you will need 2 from loopring.io (under avatar > security > export account) and 1 API key from MetaMask (... > Account Details > Export Private Key) or GameStop (account > settings > Export Account = Private Key).

Be sure that you are using the same wallet address for loopring.io and MetaMask/GameStop. Also, be sure that the Nft you want to transfer is in this wallet. 

Wallet addresses can be ENS and/or long wallet address. Just be sure that there is one on each line in the Input.txt.

### What about LoopDropSharp?

Maize is the successor to LoopDropSharp. From here on out LoopDropSharp will no longer be worked on as Maize has taken its place.

However, if you have used LDS then you will love Maize. It has all the same functionality and more. Improved error handling, faster performance, intuitive interface, and yes, all data is logged to a csv file to use in notepad or excel.

## More to Come

I feel that this is a very valuable tool for creators. I would like to make it more user friendly and add more features. If you need help or have suggestions, please reach out to me at the contact information below.
