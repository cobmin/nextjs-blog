## How to and Tips

The video gives a good overview and the readme a bit more detail but here are some more tips:

For the API keys you will need 2 from loopring.io (under avatar > security > export account) and 1 API key from MetaMask (... > Account Details > Export Private Key) or GameStop (account > settings > Export Account = Private Key).

Be sure that you are using the same wallet address for loopring.io and MetaMask/GameStop. Also, be sure that the Nft you want to transfer is in this wallet. 

Wallet addresses can be ENS and/or long wallet address. Just be sure that there is one on each line in the Input.txt.
