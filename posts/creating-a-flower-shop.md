Hey everyone.

Over the past year I have been learning about the blockchain and what it can provide. An interesting utility are non-fungible tokens or NFTs. Some people seem skeptical of them, but I believe their utilizations are being discovered.

Currently, I am creating NFTs with the end goal to be to start a Flower Shop. The plans are loose, but a more solid plan to come. Next step beingâ€¦create a business plan.

Right now, I am giving away a free NFT to anyone who wants one. Donations are welcome but not required. To receive one, please read and fill out this [form](https://forms.office.com/r/HvjDR9b9qD).

*Note that you will need an L2 wallet on the Loopring protocol to receive this NFT.
