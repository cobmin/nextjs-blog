Updated information [located here](https://cobmin.io/posts/Maize).

If you need to transfer an Nft to many users, then look no further. With the help of others, I have a tool that can do this for you. I have used this tool to airdrop hundreds of Nfts for a few creators and have shown others how to use it. I am making a user-friendly version because I think this tool should be in any creatorâ€™s tool kit.

## Requirements

This was written in .NET 6 so you need an IDE that can compile it. I use [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

The files [on GitHub](https://github.com/cobmin/LoopringBatchNftTransferDemoSharp) > Code > Download ZIP.

## How to and Tips

The video gives a good overview and the readme give a bit more detail but here are some more tips:

For the API keys you will need 2 from loopring.io under avatar > security > export account and 1 API key from metamask > ... > Account Details > Export Private Key.

Be sure that you are using the same wallet for loopring.io and metamask and that the Nft you want to transfer is in this wallet. 

Wallet addresses can be ENS and/or long wallet address. Just be sure that there is one on each line.
